        Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend
        the necessary time needed to understand your product vision. 
        <br>The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level
        statement of work. 
        <br>Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just
        the pieces you need.

           Planning and development is iterative. Because we are constantly
           coding and testing, the products we build are always ready to go
           live. This iterative process allows for changes as business
           requirements evolve.
